# SignatureInfo Context Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The SignatureInfo context manages the state and logic for Section 30 (Signature/Continuation Space) of the form. This section handles various authorization releases including information release, medical information release, and credit reporting disclosure and authorization.

## Key Components

### 1. SignatureInfo.tsx

**Core Context Provider:**
- Provides the `SignatureInfoContext` for managing signature and authorization data
- Includes specialized handlers for different authorization types and their related sections
- Integrates with the global form context for data persistence

**Main Functionality:**
- `updateSignatureField`: Updates field values with dot-notation path support
- `setInformationRelease`, `setMedicalRelease`, `setCreditRelease`: Toggle specific authorization types
- Dynamic array handling:
  - `addSection30_1`/`removeSection30_1`: Manage Section 30.1 entries (information authorization)
  - `addSection30_2`/`removeSection30_2`: Manage Section 30.2 entries (medical authorization)
  - `addSection30_3`/`removeSection30_3`: Manage Section 30.3 entries (credit authorization)

**Special Features:**
- Uses effect hook to load initial data from Redux store
- Handles nested data objects with support for array manipulation
- Implements conditional field display based on user authorization responses

### 2. SignatureInfoWrapper.tsx

**Integration Layer:**
- Bridges the SignatureInfo context with the RenderSignature component
- Provides a unified interface matching the FormProps requirements
- Special handling for different section types

**Implementation Details:**
- `SignatureInfoContent`: Inner component consuming the context
- `handleInputChange`: Special case handling for authorization fields vs. regular fields
- `handleAddEntry`/`handleRemoveEntry`: Path-based handlers for different section types
- `getDefaultNewItem`: Provides appropriate templates for different section types

### 3. Interface & Type Definitions

**Key Interfaces:**
- `Signature`: Main interface with conditional sections
- Sub-interfaces:
  - `Section30_1`: For information release authorization details
  - `Section30_2`: For medical information release authorization details
  - `Section30_3`: For credit information release authorization details
  - `Address`: Reusable address interface for sections that require it

**Field Types:**
- Follow the standard `Field<T>` pattern
- Strong typing for binary selection fields with predefined options
- Address fields handled through a dedicated interface

## Integration Points

### Route Integration

The SignatureInfo context is primarily integrated through:
- Route-level integration in `app/routes/form/signature.tsx`
- The FormHandler component using the SignatureInfoWrapper

### Redux Store Connection

Data persistence is handled through:
- `useFormContext` hook for Redux integration
- Initial loading from the store via `getSectionData`
- Updates to the store via `updateField`

## Conditional Logic

### Authorization-based Conditional Fields

The context implements the following conditional logic:
1. If information release authorization is "YES", show Section 30.1 fields
2. If medical information release authorization is "YES", show Section 30.2 fields
3. If credit information release authorization is "YES", show Section 30.3 fields
4. If any of these authorizations are changed to "NO", the corresponding fields are cleared

## Special Handling Considerations

### Address Fields

- Address structure is consistent across authorization sections
- Each includes street, city, state, zip, and country fields
- State and country implemented as dropdown fields
- Other fields as standard text inputs

### Date Handling

- All date fields follow MM/DD/YYYY pattern
- Date signed fields are present in all authorization sections

## Testing Approach

The SignatureInfo implementation should be tested for:
1. Correct initial state loading
2. Proper update of individual fields
3. Addition and removal of section entries
4. Conditional field visibility based on authorization responses
5. Integration with the Redux store
6. Proper form submission with formatted field IDs

## Implementation Pattern

This context follows the project's established pattern for form sections:
1. Define TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Create a context provider with specialized handlers for different entry types
3. Provide a wrapper component for integration with the form system
4. Connect to the Redux store for persistence
5. Handle conditional logic based on user selections

## Developer Notes

When modifying this section:
- Maintain the conditional logic for showing/hiding different sections
- Preserve the relationship between authorization toggles and their related sections
- Follow existing patterns for field updates and Redux integration
- Be aware of the RenderSignature component's expectations for data structure
- Ensure proper path handling in the wrapper component for the different section entries
