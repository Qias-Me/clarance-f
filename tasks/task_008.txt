# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement round-trip verification utility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a utility to verify that values can be correctly written to and read from the PDF.
# Details:
Develop a utility that performs round-trip verification for PDF fields. For each field, the utility should write a test value to the PDF, read it back, and verify that the read value matches the written value. This utility will be used in tests to ensure the integrity of the PDF field operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test the utility with various field types and values to ensure it correctly identifies any discrepancies. Include edge cases like special characters, maximum length values, and different field types.
