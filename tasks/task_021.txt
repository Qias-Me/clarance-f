# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement field coverage reporting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a reporting system to track field coverage across all sections.
# Details:
Implement a reporting system that tracks field coverage across all 29 sections of the SF-86 form. The report should show which fields have been implemented in the UI and which are still missing. Include metrics such as the percentage of fields covered for each section and overall. This will help ensure 100% field coverage as required by the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Generate the field coverage report and verify that it accurately reflects the implementation status of all fields. Test with partially implemented sections to ensure the report correctly identifies missing fields.
