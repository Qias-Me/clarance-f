# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Section 1-5 UI components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create UI components for the first five sections of the SF-86 form.
# Details:
Implement UI components for Sections 1-5 of the SF-86 form (Full Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth, Social Security Number, Other Names Used). Each component should use the base form components and integrate with the field mapping service to read from and write to the PDF. Ensure the components match the layout and behavior of the corresponding sections in the PDF.

# Test Strategy:
Test the components by entering valid and invalid data and verifying that the data is correctly validated and written to the PDF. Test the round-trip functionality by writing data and then reading it back to ensure consistency.
