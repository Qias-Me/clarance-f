# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement integration tests for round-trip verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create integration tests that verify the round-trip functionality for all sections.
# Details:
Implement integration tests that verify the round-trip functionality for all 29 sections of the SF-86 form. For each section, the tests should write test data to all fields, read the data back, and verify that the read data matches the written data. Use the round-trip verification utility developed earlier.

# Test Strategy:
Run the integration tests and verify that all tests pass. Ensure the tests cover all sections and fields of the SF-86 form.
