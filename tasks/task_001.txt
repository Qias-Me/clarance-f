# Title: Set up Cloudflare Workers project with React Router v7
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project using Cloudflare's React Router template and configure the development environment.
# Details:
Run `npm create cloudflare@latest sf86-wizard -- --framework=react-router` to create the project. Configure Vite for local development. Install necessary dependencies including pdf-lib. Set up the project structure with folders for components, services, utils, and tests. Configure TypeScript for type safety.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the project builds and runs locally using `npm run dev`. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the development server starts without errors.
