# Task ID: 3
# Title: Generate section-based JSON schemas from PDF metadata
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create JSON schemas for all 29 sections based on the extracted PDF field metadata.
# Details:
Process the extracted PDF field metadata to generate JSON schemas for each of the 29 sections. Each schema should include the section ID, name, and a complete list of fields with their constraints. Map the PDF field IDs to human-readable keys following the naming convention in the PRD (e.g., section1.fullName). Store these schemas in a structured format that can be used for validation and UI generation. Enhance the implementation to ensure proper field mapping to human-readable keys and provide confidence scores for mapping accuracy.

# Test Strategy:
Validate that each schema correctly represents its corresponding section in the PDF. Ensure all fields are included and properly mapped to human-readable keys. Verify the schemas are valid JSON and follow the expected structure. Test the confidence scoring mechanism to ensure it accurately reflects the reliability of field mappings.
