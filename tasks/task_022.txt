# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement PDF version tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system to track the version of the SF-86 PDF being used.
# Details:
Implement a system to track the version of the SF-86 PDF being used by the application. Store the PDF hash or version number and check it when the application starts. If the PDF has changed, trigger a warning or re-run the parser to update the field metadata. This will help mitigate the risk of schema drift when the PDF is updated.

# Test Strategy:
Test the version tracking by using different versions of the SF-86 PDF and verifying that the system correctly identifies changes. Ensure the appropriate actions are taken when a change is detected.
