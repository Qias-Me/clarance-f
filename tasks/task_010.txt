# Description: Create a logging system for tracking PDF read/write operations.
# Details:
Implement a logging system that records all PDF read and write operations. Each log entry should include the timestamp, operation type (read/write), field ID, and value (for write operations). The logs should be stored in a format that can be easily reviewed for debugging and auditing purposes.
