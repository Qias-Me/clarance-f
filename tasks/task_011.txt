# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create base form components with validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop reusable form components that integrate with the validation schemas.
# Details:
Create a set of reusable form components (text input, checkbox, radio, select, etc.) that integrate with the validation schemas. Each component should validate user input against the appropriate schema and provide feedback for invalid input. The components should be styled consistently and support all the field types used in the SF-86 form.

# Test Strategy:
Test the components with valid and invalid input to ensure they correctly validate and provide feedback. Verify that the components render correctly and handle user interactions as expected.
