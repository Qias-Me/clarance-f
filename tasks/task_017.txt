# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Section 26-29 UI components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create UI components for sections 26-29 of the SF-86 form.
# Details:
Implement UI components for Sections 26-29 of the SF-86 form (Financial Record, Use of Information Technology Systems, Involvement in Non-Criminal Court Actions, Association Record). Each component should use the base form components and integrate with the field mapping service. Ensure the components match the layout and behavior of the corresponding sections in the PDF.

# Test Strategy:
Test the components by entering valid and invalid data and verifying that the data is correctly validated and written to the PDF. Test the round-trip functionality by writing data and then reading it back to ensure consistency.
