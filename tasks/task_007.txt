# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create field mapping service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a service that maps between human-readable field keys and PDF field IDs.
# Details:
Implement a service that translates between the human-readable field keys (e.g., section1.fullName) and the corresponding PDF field IDs. This service should use the JSON schemas to perform the mapping. Include methods for both directions: from key to ID and from ID to key. This service will be used by the UI components to interact with the PDF field service.

# Test Strategy:
Test the service with various field keys to ensure they correctly map to the expected PDF field IDs and vice versa. Verify that all fields from all sections can be correctly mapped.
