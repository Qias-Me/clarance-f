# Task ID: 24
# Title: Optimize application performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 18
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize the performance of the application, particularly for PDF operations.
# Details:
Analyze and optimize the performance of the application, with a focus on PDF operations which may be resource-intensive. Implement techniques such as memoization, lazy loading, and efficient state management to improve performance. Ensure the application remains responsive even when dealing with large PDFs or complex sections.

# Test Strategy:
Measure the performance of the application before and after optimization using appropriate metrics (e.g., load time, operation time). Verify that the optimizations result in measurable improvements without affecting functionality.
