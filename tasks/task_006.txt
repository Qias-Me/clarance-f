# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement PDF field service for writing by ID
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service that can write field values to the SF-86 PDF using field IDs.
# Details:
Extend the PDF field service to include functionality for writing values to fields in the SF-86 PDF. The service should accept a field ID and a value, and update the PDF accordingly. Include validation to ensure the value meets any constraints defined in the PDF (e.g., character limits, allowed options). Handle different field types appropriately.

# Test Strategy:
Test the service by writing values to various fields and then reading them back to verify they were correctly written. Include edge cases and test with invalid values to ensure proper validation.
