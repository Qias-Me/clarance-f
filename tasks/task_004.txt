# Task ID: 4
# Title: Generate TypeScript interfaces from JSON schemas
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create TypeScript interfaces for all 29 sections based on the JSON schemas.
# Details:
Develop a utility to generate TypeScript interfaces from the JSON schemas. Each interface should represent a section and include all fields with their proper types. Ensure the interfaces follow the naming convention in the PRD. The interfaces should be used throughout the application to ensure type safety and consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the generated TypeScript interfaces match the JSON schemas. Ensure all fields are correctly typed and the interfaces compile without errors.
