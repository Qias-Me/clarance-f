# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create PDF parsing utility to extract field metadata
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a utility that extracts all field IDs, constraints, and metadata from the SF-86 PDF.
# Details:
Use pdf-lib to programmatically read the SF-86 PDF and extract all form fields. For each field, capture the ID, type, default value, options (if applicable), and any constraints like character limits. Store the extracted metadata in a structured format that can be used to generate JSON schemas for each section.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all fields from the PDF are correctly extracted by comparing the count and IDs with a manual inspection of the PDF. Test with different versions of the SF-86 PDF to ensure robustness.
