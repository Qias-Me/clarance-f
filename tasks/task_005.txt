# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement PDF field service for reading by ID
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service that can read field values from the SF-86 PDF using field IDs.
# Details:
Implement a service using pdf-lib that can read field values from the SF-86 PDF. The service should accept a field ID and return the current value of that field. Include error handling for cases where the field ID doesn't exist or the PDF cannot be read. The service should be able to handle all field types (text, checkbox, radio, etc.).

# Test Strategy:
Test the service with various field IDs to ensure it correctly reads values from the PDF. Include edge cases like empty fields, fields with special characters, and fields of different types.
