# Section 21 Data Persistence Fix - Test Results

## Issue Analysis Summary

**Root Cause Identified**: Section 21 was missing its React context provider implementation.

### Problems Found:
1. **Missing Context Provider**: The `section21.tsx` file only contained TypeScript interfaces and utility functions, but lacked the actual React context provider implementation.
2. **Missing useSection21 Hook**: The `Section21Component.tsx` was trying to use `useSection21()` hook, but this hook didn't exist.
3. **Provider Not Registered**: Section21Provider was commented out in the `CompleteSF86FormProvider`.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created Section21Context Provider
- ✅ Added React context provider following Section 1/29 patterns
- ✅ Implemented state management with useState for section21Data
- ✅ Added useSection21 hook
- ✅ Integrated with SF86FormContext using useSection86FormIntegration

### 2. Implemented CRUD Operations
- ✅ `updateSubsectionFlag` - for YES/NO radio buttons
- ✅ `updateEntryField` - for updating fields within entries  
- ✅ `addEntry` / `removeEntry` - for managing dynamic entries
- ✅ `updateFieldValue` - generic field update for SF86FormContext integration

### 3. Added Validation and Utility Functions
- ✅ `validateSection` - section-level validation
- ✅ `resetSection` / `loadSection` - utility functions
- ✅ `getChanges` - change tracking for SF86FormContext
- ✅ `getTotalMentalHealthEntries` - utility function used by component
- ✅ `hasAnyMentalHealthIssues` - utility function used by component

### 4. Registered Provider
- ✅ Added Section21Provider import to SF86FormContext.tsx
- ✅ Uncommented Section21Provider in the provider chain
- ✅ Ensured proper provider nesting

## Expected Data Flow (Now Fixed)

```
User Input → Section21Component 
    ↓
handleFieldChange → updateSubsectionFlag/updateEntryField 
    ↓
Section21Context (useState) 
    ↓
sf86Form.updateSectionData('section21', section21Data)
    ↓
SF86FormContext (formData state)
    ↓
sf86Form.saveForm() → IndexedDB via dynamicService.ts
    ↓
PDF Generation (field mapping via section-21.json)
```

## Files Modified

1. **app/state/contexts/sections2.0/section21.tsx**
   - Added complete React context provider implementation
   - Added CRUD operations and validation
   - Added utility functions

2. **app/state/contexts/SF86FormContext.tsx**
   - Added Section21Provider import
   - Uncommented Section21Provider in provider chain

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Navigate to `/startForm` in browser
2. Click on Section 21
3. Test radio button interactions (YES/NO)
4. Add mental health entries
5. Fill out form fields
6. Check browser console for data flow logs
7. Verify data persists when navigating away and back
8. Test form submission and PDF generation

### Console Debugging:
The implementation includes extensive console logging:
- `🔄 Section21Context:` - Context operations
- `🎯 Section21Component:` - Component interactions  
- `✅ Section21Context:` - Successful updates
- `🔍 SF86FormContext:` - Global form updates

### Expected Console Output:
```
🎯 Section21Component handleFlagChange called: {subsectionKey: "mentalHealthConsultations", value: "YES"}
🔄 Section21Context: updateSubsectionFlag called with mentalHealthConsultations = YES
✅ Section21Context: updateSubsectionFlag updated data: [object]
🔍 SF86FormContext: updateSectionData called for Section 21: [object]
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Section 21 loads without "must be used within" errors
- [ ] Radio buttons update context state
- [ ] Adding entries works correctly
- [ ] Field changes persist in context
- [ ] Data flows to SF86FormContext
- [ ] Data saves to IndexedDB
- [ ] PDF generation includes Section 21 data
- [ ] Navigation preserves Section 21 data

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** by running the development server
2. **Verify data persistence** by checking IndexedDB in browser dev tools
3. **Test PDF generation** to ensure field mapping works correctly
4. **Compare with Section 1** to ensure consistent behavior patterns
5. **Add automated tests** for Section 21 context and component

The Section 21 data persistence issue should now be resolved with proper context provider implementation and SF86FormContext integration.
