# Expert suggestions

/sc:improve code/ --fix --focus maintainability
# Refined improvements
- Use npm run dev and navigate there with playwright mcp to test the implementation
- Always refine the code we already have before creating new files. 

You'll need to test the implementation by running "npm run dev" anf going to localhost:5173 the componenet should allow you to interact with the state on load to see section 1 for interaction
- Building features incrementally
# Feature 1: Unified Section Integration
/sc:implement "section 1 - 5 UI integration into pdf."
/sc:test --focus functionality
/sc:document --type api

# Feature 2: Iterations for Quality
/sc:implement "Check Section 1 - 5"
@agent-refactoring-expert "I should have much code already to accomplish this task but I feel theres a bit too much rednundant code as well"
/sc:test --focus quality

# Feature 3: Unified Section Integration
/sc:implement "section 6-9 UI integration into pdf."
@agent-frontend-architect "ensure consistency"

# Each feature builds on conversation context
- Always refine the code we already have before creating new files.
