🔍 DEBUGGING ANALYSIS - Field "9782 0 R" Issue
================================================================

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- Field Name: "form1[0].Section11[0].From_Datefield_Name_2[2]"
- Field ID: "9782 0 R"
- Expected Section: 11 (based on "Section11" in name)
- Actual Final Section: 15
- Issue: Self-healing is overriding the initial Section 11 assignment

KEY FINDINGS FROM TERMINAL OUTPUT:
================================================================

1. TARGET FIELD TRACKING RESULT:
   🔍 TARGET FIELD TRACKING - AFTER SELF-HEALING:
      Field ID: 9782 0 R
      Field Name: form1[0].Section11[0].From_Datefield_Name_2[2]
      Section: 15
      Confidence: 0.7
      isExplicitlyDetected: false  ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE
      wasMovedByHealing: true      ⚠️ CONFIRMS MOVEMENT
      🚨 SECTION CHANGED: 11 → 15

2. REGEX PATTERN TEST RESULTS:
   ✅ parseExplicitSection pattern /\bsection[_\s-]*(\d+)\b/i MATCHES "section11" → captures "11"
   ✅ parseFormSection pattern /form\d+\[\d+\]\.section(\d+)\[\d+\]/i MATCHES "form1[0].section11[0]" → captures "11"

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   - The EncapsulatedFieldParser SHOULD detect Section 11 (patterns match)
   - BUT isExplicitlyDetected = false (explicit detection FAILED)
   - Since explicit detection failed, protection logic doesn't protect the field
   - Self-healing moves field from Section 11 → Section 15

DEBUGGING STEPS TAKEN:
================================================================

1. ✅ Added debugging to EncapsulatedFieldParser.parseFieldHierarchy()
2. ✅ Added debugging to EncapsulatedFieldParser.parseFormSection()
3. ✅ Added debugging to fieldParsing.extractSectionInfo()
4. ✅ Added debugging to index.ts extractExplicitSectionFromName()
5. ✅ Added debugging to consolidated-self-healing.ts extractExplicitSectionFromName()
6. ✅ Fixed engine.ts to preserve isExplicitlyDetected flag in batch processing
7. ✅ Verified regex patterns work correctly with test script

MISSING DEBUG OUTPUT:
================================================================

❌ NO debugging logs from EncapsulatedFieldParser appeared in terminal output
❌ NO debugging logs from fieldParsing.extractSectionInfo appeared
❌ NO debugging logs from explicit section detection functions appeared

This suggests:
1. The field is NOT going through these functions at all, OR
2. The debugging logs are being filtered/suppressed, OR
3. There's a different code path being used

NEXT INVESTIGATION STEPS:
================================================================

1. Check if the field goes through a different parsing path
2. Verify if EncapsulatedFieldParser is actually being called
3. Check if there are multiple field processing pipelines
4. Look for any code that might be overriding the initial section assignment
5. Check the order of operations in the main processing pipeline

SELF-HEALING BEHAVIOR:
================================================================

The self-healing process shows:
- Total corrections made: 1006
- Final Alignment Score: 100.00%
- The field was moved from Section 11 → Section 15 during self-healing
- This suggests the initial assignment was Section 11, but self-healing moved it

HYPOTHESIS:
================================================================

The field IS initially assigned to Section 11 correctly, but:
1. It's not marked as isExplicitlyDetected = true
2. Self-healing sees it as a "moveable" field
3. Self-healing moves it to Section 15 to balance section counts
4. The protection logic fails because isExplicitlyDetected = false

SOLUTION APPROACH:
================================================================

Need to ensure that fields with "Section11" in their name are:
1. Properly detected by explicit section detection
2. Marked with isExplicitlyDetected = true
3. Protected from self-healing movement

The issue is likely in the explicit detection pipeline not working correctly.

🎉 ISSUE RESOLVED! - TEST25 RESULTS:
================================================================

✅ SUCCESS: The fix is working correctly!

FINAL RESULTS FROM TEST25:
   Field ID: 9782 0 R
   Field Name: form1[0].Section11[0].From_Datefield_Name_2[2]
   Section: 11                    ✅ CORRECT SECTION!
   Confidence: 0.99               ✅ HIGH CONFIDENCE!
   isExplicitlyDetected: true     ✅ EXPLICIT DETECTION WORKING!
   wasMovedByHealing: false       ✅ NOT MOVED BY HEALING!

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
================================================================

The issue was in src/sectionizer/index.ts at lines 1853-1854:

BEFORE (BROKEN):
   isExplicitlyDetected: !isFormPathPattern

AFTER (FIXED):
   const shouldMarkAsExplicit = !isFormPathPattern || explicitResult.confidence >= 0.99;
   isExplicitlyDetected: shouldMarkAsExplicit

EXPLANATION:
- Fields with "form1[0].Section11[0]..." were detected correctly as Section 11
- But they were marked as isExplicitlyDetected = false because they were "form path patterns"
- This caused the protection logic to fail, allowing self-healing to move them
- The fix ensures high-confidence form path patterns (confidence >= 0.99) are also marked as explicitly detected
- This protects them from being moved by self-healing

VERIFICATION:
- The field now stays in Section 11 (correct)
- It has isExplicitlyDetected = true (protected)
- It was not moved by self-healing (wasMovedByHealing = false)
- High confidence score (0.99)

The issue has been successfully resolved!
