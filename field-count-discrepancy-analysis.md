### Summary Statistics

- **Total Expected Fields:** 649
- **Total Actual Fields:** 85
- **Missing Fields:** 564
- **Missing Percentage:** 86.9%
- **Collection Efficiency:** 13.1%

## üîç Potential Root Causes

1. **Section Integration Issues**
   - Sections not properly registered with SF86FormContext
   - Missing provider wrappers in startForm.tsx
   - Incomplete section context implementations

2. **Data Collection Problems**
   - exportForm() function not collecting from all sections
   - collectAllSectionData() missing section references
   - Field traversal logic not reaching all section data

3. **Field Structure Issues**
   - Sections using different field structures
   - Missing Field<T> interface compliance
   - Incorrect field ID formats

4. **Provider Chain Breaks**
   - Missing section providers in component tree
   - Context not properly propagating
   - Integration hooks not functioning

## üéØ Investigation Priority

**High Priority Sections (Large Field Counts):**
1. Section 4: 138 fields (21.3% of total)
2. Section 29: 141 fields (21.7% of total)
3. Section 10: 122 fields (18.8% of total)
4. Section 9: 78 fields (12.0% of total)
5. Section 27: 57 fields (8.8% of total)

**Combined High Priority:** 536 fields (82.6% of total expected)

## üìã Next Steps

1. Audit SF86FormContext integration
2. Verify section provider integration in startForm.tsx
3. Analyze form data collection process
4. Cross-reference field IDs with sections-references
5. Fix missing section integrations
