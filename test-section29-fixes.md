# Section 29 Fixes Verification Test

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Console Log Spam (Infinite Re-registrations)
**Problem**: `useSection86FormIntegration` hook was causing infinite re-registrations due to overlapping useEffect dependencies.

**Root Cause**: 
- First useEffect depended on `registerSection` function
- Second useEffect also depended on `registerSection` function  
- `registerSection` function depended on `createSectionContext` which changed when `sectionData` changed
- This created an infinite loop: sectionData changes → registerSection changes → useEffect runs → registration → cycle repeats

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `registerSection` dependency from both useEffect hooks
- First useEffect now only depends on `[sectionId, sectionName, integration]`
- Second useEffect now only depends on `[sectionData]` with heavy throttling (5 second minimum between registrations)
- Added time-based throttling to prevent spam

### 2. Section 29 Data Persistence Issue
**Problem**: Section 29 form values were not persisting in the form context or being submitted to PDF.

**Root Cause**: 
- Section 29's `useSection86FormIntegration` call was missing the `updateFieldValue` parameter
- Without this parameter, the SF86FormContext had no way to sync Section 29 data directly
- Data updates stayed local to Section 29 context but never reached the central form context

**Fix Applied**:
- Added missing `updateFieldValue` parameter to Section 29's integration hook
- Created `updateFieldValueWrapper` function to bridge the signature mismatch:
  - Integration expects: `(path: string, value: any) => void`
  - Section 29 has: `(subsectionKey, entryIndex, fieldPath, newValue) => void`
- Wrapper function parses paths like "section29.subsectionKey.entries[index].fieldPath" and calls Section 29's updateFieldValue correctly

## Test Instructions

### Test 1: Console Log Spam Fix
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5174/startForm
3. Go to Section 29
4. Check console - should see minimal registration logs instead of spam
5. Type in Section 29 fields - should not see repeated registrations

### Test 2: Section 29 Data Persistence Fix  
1. Navigate to Section 29
2. Add a new organization entry
3. Fill in organization name, address, dates
4. Check browser dev tools → Application → IndexedDB → sf86-form-data
5. Verify Section 29 data is saved with the entered values
6. Refresh page and verify data persists
7. Try PDF generation - Section 29 data should appear in PDF

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Console spam: Repeated "SectionRegistry: Registering section29" messages every few seconds
- Data loss: Section 29 form inputs not saved to IndexedDB or PDF

### After Fix:
- Clean console: Only initial registration message, no spam
- Data persistence: Section 29 form inputs properly saved and restored
- PDF generation: Section 29 data correctly included in PDF output

## Data Flow Verification

### Working Section 1 Flow (Reference):
```
User Input → handleFieldChange → updateFieldValue → setSection1Data → Integration Hook → SF86FormContext → IndexedDB
```

### Fixed Section 29 Flow:
```
User Input → handleFieldChange → updateFieldValue → setSection29Data → updateFieldValueWrapper → Integration Hook → SF86FormContext → IndexedDB
```

The key difference is the `updateFieldValueWrapper` that bridges the signature mismatch between Section 29's complex updateFieldValue function and the integration hook's expected simple signature.
